# minilanguage-compiler-demo
I've helped develop this compiler demo for a mini-language for a Formal Languages and Compilers course at Universitatea Transilvania Brasov. The interpreter uses ANTLR to generate a lexer and parser for the miniLang language and implements a visitor pattern to interpret the parsed code. The application is written in C# and uses .NET 8.0.

⚠️ Note: I did not write this code entirely myself; it was completed as part of a university assignment.

⚠️ Note: This program is partially in Romanian.

🔧 Features
- Lexical analysis and parsing via ANTLR
- Visitor-based interpretation of the parse tree
- Example source files demonstrating miniLang usage
  
🎯 Educational Focus
- Learning how to use ANTLR
- Working in C# for the first time - this was the first project I've ever coded in C#!
  
📁 Technologies Used
- C#
- ANTLR
- .NET 8.0

💡 How to Run
- Open Program.sln in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the project.
- Modify or add miniLang source files to test new inputs.
